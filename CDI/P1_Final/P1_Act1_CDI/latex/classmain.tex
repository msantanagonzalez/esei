Case 1.\+2 .A thread is created using the Thread class and Runnable interface

Create the threads

Start the threads

Wait until there큦 no running threads

Case 1.\+3 .A thread is created using the Thread class and Runnable interface, and when running displays a message on screen after one second

Create the threads

Start the threads

Wait until there큦 no running threads

Case 1.\+4 .A thread is created using the Runnable interface, and list the threads what are running on screen

Create the thread

Start the thread

List the threads what are running on screen

Wait until there큦 no running thread

Case 2.\+1 .From the command line parameters receive few threads to create, the program will create and execute the indicated number of threads and show a messages on the screen.

It creates the number of threads specified and start the threads

Wait until there큦 no running threads

Case 2.\+2 .From the command line parameters receive few threads to create, the program will create and execute the indicated number of threads and show a runtime each thread on the screen.

It creates the number of threads specified and start the threads

Wait until there큦 no running threads

Case 2.\+4 .From the command line parameters receive few threads to create, the program will create and execute the indicated number of threads and displays the total time it takes to run all the threads on the screen.

It creates the number of threads specified and start the threads

Wait until there큦 no running threads

Calculates and displays the total run time of the threads

Case 2.\+5 .In this case displays the creation time and execution of the threads on the screen.

It creates the number of threads specified and start the threads

Calculates and displays the creation time and execution time of the threads

Case 2.\+6 .The program creates and executes a growing number of threads, displaying messages on screen and performing mathematical operations and shows a graph in which the number of threads in relation compared with the runtime

It creates the number of threads specified and start the threads

Wait until there큦 no running threads

Creates the main frame(\+Window)

Case 3.\+2 .The program create and execute the threads and show the difference between the interrupted () and interrupted () methods

Create and start the thread

Use of method is\+Interrupted()

Create and start the thread

Use of method interrupted()

Wait until there큦 no running threads

Case 3.\+3 .The program create and execute the thread and and waits for a possible signal to be interrupted.

Create and start the thread

Case 3.\+3 .The program create and execute the thread and and waits for a possible signal to be interrupted by the user .

Wait until there큦 no running threads
